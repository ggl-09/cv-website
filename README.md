# Hypermedia Project Part 1 - Create your CV website
## User profile
John Smith is a recruiter at a technological company. The business is looking for a web and software developer
to satisfy the project demands by their clients.

He reviews many portfolios weekly to try to easily identify candidates that have the technical and personal skills
necessary to achieve the desired results.

He wants to quickly assess the applicant's abilities, because of this, he is looking for a clean, intuitive and easily
navigable CV.

## Information architecture
The website CV is a one-page layout divided into clear and defined sections that go through my profile. The fixed
navigation bar at the top makes it easy to access any of the sections fast.

Starting on the tab bar, I have put a small icon of a computer to give it bit more of style and as for the title I have
put my name and my title, so the person that reads it can easily identify my CV. There's also a button that sends you to
my GitHub profile.

As you open the page, it introduces my name and my studies, after that, the page is divided in the following sections:

- **About me:** it consists of a brief presentation about my background and values. It also overviews some of my skills.
- **Technical skills:** it provides a list of the programming languages I feel confident I can work and develop a good 
project.
Below it, there's also a list of the languages I can speak and understand and at what level.
- **Personal skills:** it provides a list of the abilities that may be of use when working in a company and that might
differentiate me from other applicants.
- **Experience:** it's a list of previous jobs (with a brief description of what it required) and also experiences that
have helped me develop my abilities.
- **Projects:** it showcases selected works with a short description and its correspondent link to GitHub for
verification.
- **Contact:** it includes my communication links (none of them are real).

Overall, my design/architecture prioritises readability and easy information access with minimal scrolling.

## Visual design
From the beginning I envisioned a dark website with a bright color to give it contrast, which would give the CV a
technical yet modern personality. I had thought of making the whole background black, but once I tried it, it was too
dark, so I used a colour close to black (#0A0A0A) combined with a dark shade of gray (#1A1A1A), which I also used to
differentiate the different sections of the CV. For the navigation bar and the footer I used black (#000000).

To accentuate different parts and to give the CV a contrast, I used a bright blue cyan (#00FFFF), which I used to
highlight the interactive elements, like buttons, borders and icons. I used the cyan because the neon tone gives a
tech-inspired look to the website, while also making it readable. I tried to use other colors to accentuate, but I found
it difficult to find two neon-like colours that match correctly and that don't break the aesthetic of the CV. To try and
follow this style, I browsed through different font styles and ended up using an "Orbitron" for the titles and heading,
giving it a robotic look and an "Inter" for the rest of the page, keeping the robotic look but also making it softer to
read.

To maintain a consistency through the web, I have used the same resources, like glowing and rounded corners, and
transitions on hover, over and over; although I also made minimal changes in each section to ensure a visual separation
but while preserving the web's unity.
